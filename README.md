## Built with 

- [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/?_ga=2.250270342.1411756360.1530765468-1692336383.1529003402)
- [Angular](https://angular.io/docs)  
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) 


## To-do
- Create a nested component for the answers to each question in the Q&A section.
- Rebuild backend using C# to allow for more relationship, thereby allowing the users a better expeience when claiming a succulent. Ideally, when one user claims a succulent it would alert the "donator" of the "requesters" necissary information. 
- More modern, detailed CSS. 
- Add an "Additional Resources" page with external sources containing more specific planting and care information. 
- Include a file upload field in the Add Succulent form for an image of the plant the user is listing.
