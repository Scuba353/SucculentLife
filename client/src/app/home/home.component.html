        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          This website is dedicated to teaching more about growing your own succulents.  Why would you pay money for
          individual plants from the store when you can grow them on your own in just a couple easy steps?  
          Propogation is a method of growing plants from a small cutting of the parent plant, 
          a single leaf in the case of most succulents, 
          into a mature plant. Check out the links to the right for some additional information on this growing method.
          If you are new to the succulent life and would like to request some cuttings lets get started.
          Find some friends through this site and request a few leaves.  In a matter of time you'll have a numebr of different species and be on your way to 
          having plants large enough to share with others! </p>
          <button class="link" [routerLink]= "['/sharable']">Get your first cuttings</button><br>
          <br><br>
          <p>Otherwise if you currently have plants you are willing to share small pieces of them with others add them to the inventory!</p>

            <p>The best soil for succulents in pots needs to drain quickly, to prevent root rot, yet hold water long enough for the roots to absorb it. There are a number of commercialy available mixes specific to cacti and succulents like the one in the photo. </p>

            <h2>Light and Water</h2>
            <p>Succulents indoors need as much light as possible.  They should be placed by a window that gets light a majority of the day! They dont need as much water though.  Generally, once a week is enough.  Throughly wet the soil and allow it to dry before rewatering.</p>

            <h2>A Leaf</h2>
            <p>Lastly, you need the plants.  One leaf with a good break from the parent is sufficient but to increase succuess you can start 3-4 leaves. Worst case is you end up wiht that many mature pants!</p>
